                            Since I was young at the age of 4 I could already use computer, download torrent files check them for potential malware, since then I knew that I want to work with IT in the future.

                            My first journey to web development started in NTI High School located in Odenplan, Stockholm. The field itself was new to me but I developed quickly due my interest, it became my hobby.
